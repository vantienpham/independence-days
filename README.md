**It has been _22 days_ since the beginning of my independent research journey.**

This repository automatically updates every day and counts the number of days since **20 November 2025**, the day my PhD contract ended and my *independent* research era began.

Yes, “independent” is the elegant academic euphemism for:  
**unemployed, unpaid, but scientifically unstoppable.** 🚀  
(If you can't get funding, at least get funny. 😉)

Each update also reminds me to reflect on:

> **“What have I done today as an independent researcher?”**
